# project-clustering-algorithms
In this project we create a synthetic dataset using the provided createdataset.py program file.
Comparison is done between K-means clustering algorithm and Agglomerative clustering algorithm.
Only a small part of actual comparison program is provided, due to continuously changing the parameters and parameter values.
